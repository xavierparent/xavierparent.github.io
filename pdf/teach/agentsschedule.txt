D. Gabbay, X. Parent, L. van der Torre
X. Sun (Teaching assistant) 

Motivation: 
---------

This course is for the students interested in artificial intelligence,
in particular formal reasoning. Normative reasoning studies how social
norms, obligations and permissions can be formalized. This enables
scientists to study various aspects of inter-agent coordination within
a system (computer network, institution, organization, group . . . ).

Objective
--------

The objective of this course is to introduce students to
formal methods for normative reasoning for agents (deontic logic)


Description
----------

We will study two recent standards for normative reasoning: so-called
dyadic deontic logic (DDL);  and so-called input/output logic. Basic
issues from the deontic logic literature will be 
revisited using these tools (conflicts, imperatives)

In addition, students will work on a small project related to the
course. The project paper should be an essay of 6 pages
length. They will be presented by students durring the last lecture. 


This course will  extend the course on Knowledge Representation, and
complement the module "Selected topics in AI 2013".
