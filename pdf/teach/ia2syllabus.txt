Motivation: 
---------

This course is for the students interested in artificial intelligence,
in particular formal reasoning. Normative reasoning studies how social
norms, obligations and permissions can be formalized. This enables
scientists to study various aspects of inter-agent coordination within
a system (computer network, institution, organization, group . . . ).

Objective
--------

The objective of this course is to introduce students to
formal methods for normative reasoning for agents (deontic logic)


Description
----------

We will study three frameworks for normative reasoning that have dominated the landscape: standard deontic logic (SDL), dyadic deontic logic (DDL), and input/output logic (I/O logic). Basic
issues from the deontic logic literature will be revisited using these
tools (conflicts, reasoning about violation)

In addition, students will work on a small project related to the
course. The project paper should be an essay of 6 pages length. They
will be presented by students durring the last lecture.

This course will extend the course on Knowledge Representation, and
complement the module "Selected topics in AI".
