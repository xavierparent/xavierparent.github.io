Objective
=========
The objective of this course is to introduce students to knowledge representation and reasoning methods for intelligent agent systems.

Description
===========

The course has 4 parts:

1. Modal logics for agent reasoning

2. Natural language semantics

3. Nonmonotonic reasoning under uncertainty 

4. Argumentation and belief revision

Learning Outcomes
=================

- Explain the nature and roles of different formal theories used for individual reasoning and autonomous agents, such as various modal logics, belief change formalisms, or methods for uncertainty management

- Define and apply the basic concepts of one or two non-classical logics (e.g. modal logic and default logics), notably their semantics and proof calculi
